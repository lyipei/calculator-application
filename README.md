# Overview

This project is a C++ Calculator Program that demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance and polymorphism. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes a feature to convert fractions to decimals.

The purpose of this project is to strengthen understanding of C++ suntax, class design, and method overriding, and to gain more hands-on experience in writing modular and reusable code. Building this calculator helped better understand how to structure class, manage dynamic objects, and apply inheritance in practical software design.

# Development Environment

The program was developed using Visual Studio Code with the C++ extension for compiling and debugging.

I used the C++ programming language, which is known for its efficiency, flexibility, and strong object-oriented features.

The project demonstrates:
- Use of classes and inheritance
- The override keyword to redefine virtual functions.
- Implementation of switch-case menus and loops for user interaction
- Proper handling of division by zero and invalid user input.

# Future Work

- Add more advanced operations such as square roots, exponents,and percentages.
- Add Improve input validation to handle non-numeric input safely.
- Include unit tests to automatically verify the correctness of each operation.
